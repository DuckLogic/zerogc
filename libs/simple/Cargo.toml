    "small-object-arenas", # Without this, allocating small objects is slow
]
# Use very fast dedicated arenas for small objects.
# This makes allocation **extremly** fast
# Time spent in malloc (even in heavy workloads) drops to near zero
# This can also improve memory significantly by avoiding per-object overheads
#
# However, it increases code complexity and is more
# agressive (memory wise) then delegating all work to std::alloc
# TODO: Return unused memory to the operating systems
small-object-arenas = ["once_cell"]
# Use recursion to implicitly track the grey stack
# This risks stack overflow at a possible performance gain
# See commit 9a9634d68a4933d
implicit-grey-stack = []
# Support thread safety
#
# This slows down allocation
# It also waits for all mutator threads to reach a safepoint
# before collection can begin. This is bacially copperative
# threading.....
