    "small-object-arenas", # Without this, allocating small objects is slow
]
# Use very fast dedicated arenas for small objects.
# This makes allocation **extremly** fast
# Time spent in malloc (even in heavy workloads) drops to near zero
# This can also improve memory significantly by avoiding per-object overheads
#
# However, it increases code complexity and is more
# agressive (memory wise) then delegating all work to std::alloc
# TODO: Return unused memory to the operating systems

# Use recursion to implicitly track the grey stack
# This risks stack overflow at a possible performance gain
